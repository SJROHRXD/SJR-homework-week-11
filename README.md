## Description 📌 ##

This app allows a user to enter and store notes. The user is greeted with a landing page, then directed to a page on which they can enter and save notes. The user can also retrieve notes, modify notes and delete notes!


### GIVEN a note-taking application ###

        WHEN I open the Note Taker
            
            THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

        WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
        
            THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
            
        WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
            
            THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
        
        WHEN I click on the Save icon
        
            THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
        
        WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
        
            THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
        
        WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
        
            THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
